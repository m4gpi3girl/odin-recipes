# odin-recipes
project: recipes

This is my first project as part of the odin project foundations course. So far, in the course I have learned how to use the command line to navigate my file system, and how I can communicate with github and the text editor from within the command line.

I have been introduced to git and this project will also aim to demonstrate ability to make commits
